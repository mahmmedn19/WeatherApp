# 🌤 Weather Now & Later

**Weather Now & Later** is a modern, modular Android application built with Jetpack Compose that allows users to view the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The app follows Clean Architecture principles, uses MVVM/MVI patterns, and stores the last searched city for convenience.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ Search and select any city  
✅ View current weather (temperature, condition, icon)  
✅ See a 5-day forecast in a list  
✅ Last searched city auto-loaded on app reopen  
✅ Swipe-to-refresh support  
✅ Responsive and clean UI using Jetpack Compose

## 🛠️ Architecture

This app follows **Clean Architecture** with these layers:

- **Presentation:** UI and ViewModel
- **Domain:** Use cases and interfaces
- **Data:** Remote and local sources, repository implementation

---


## 🧩 Modularity

Each feature is isolated in its own Gradle module to improve maintainability, scalability, and build times.

```
features/
│
├── cityinput/
├── currentweather/
└── forecast/
```

---

## 🏗️ Custom Library

`weather-utils` module is published to local Maven and used in `core` and `features`.

Tools included:

- `TemperatureFormatter.kt`
- `DateFormatter.kt`
- `WeatherIconMapper.kt`

> 📦 Published locally via:
```bash
./gradlew :weather-utils:publish
```

---

## 🧠 Navigation

Uses `Navigation Compose` with Kotlin serialization for type-safe navigation.

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class ForecastScreen(val city: String)
```
